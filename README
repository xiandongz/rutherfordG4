                            ------------

 This program demonstrates the Rutherford Scattering experiment with
 a 1 micro-meter thickness gold foil and a sensor to get the alpha
 particles after the scattering.


 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION

   The geometry is constructed in the myDetectorConstruction class.
   The setup consists of a box shape target (Au) and a box shape
   sensor. The material of the World is vacuo.

 2- PHYSICS LIST

   The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
   in this program are set in the QBBC physics list. This physics list
   requires data files for electromagnetic and hadronic processes. The
   datas which are mandatory for this program have been installed.

 3- PRIMARY GENERATOR

   The primary generator is defined in the myPrimaryGeneratorAction class.
   The default kinematics is a 5.488 MeV alpha, distributed in a round
   area with 2mm diameter, also passed a straight hole with 1mm thickness
   and 1mm diameter. A root file in data folder provides the initial
   information about these alpha particles.
